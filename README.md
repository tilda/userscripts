# Userscripts
Various userscripts I use myself. Publishing them because useful things shouldn't just be for me. 

## How do I use userscripts?!
Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) in your browser. Legitimately all there is to it. Once you've done that you can install the various scripts here by clicking on the respective header. (Also check out [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org) for more scripts beyond this repository.)

# [Headcount](https://github.com/tilda/userscripts/raw/main/headcount/headcount.user.js)
A decently hacky script for the osu! website that shows the amount of mutual friends you have.
